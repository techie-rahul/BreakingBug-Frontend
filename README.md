## Introduction
This repository contains the frontend code for the Breaking Bug event. The event is organized by IEEE Computer Society, Manipal University Jaipur.

Breaking Bug is an electrifying virtual showdown for tech enthusiasts and coding maestros! An exciting and challenging event where participants step into the shoes of skilled developers and problem-solvers! In this unique competition, their mission is to identify and fix bugs in a GitHub repository across three diverse domains: Frontend, Backend, and Machine Learning (ML).


## Pre-requisites
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [React](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)


## How to get started?

- Fork the repository.
- Clone the repository in your local system.
- Follow the steps mentioned in the [Setting up the project](#setting-up-the-project) section.
- Once you have set up the project, you can start working on the issues.
- After you have made the changes, push the code to your forked repository.
- Put the link to your forked repository in the Google Forms which will be shared with you.
- Host the website on vercel using the mentioned in the pdf.


## Setting up the project

Fork the repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the top right corner of the page.

Clone the repository in your local system.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/BreakingBug-Frontend.git
```

Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd BreakingBug-Frontend
```

Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables.
```bash
REACT_APP_BASE_URL="https://breaking-bug-backend.vercel.app"
```

Start the server.
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
